# Tier 1: MVP Shopping Experience

1. As a customer/visitor, I want to be able to:

-   Access a deployed version of the website so I can browse and purchase products.
-   View all available products so I can pick from a variety.
-   View a single product so I can see more details.
-   Add a product to my cart so I can collect my desired products in one place.
-   Edit my cart if I change my mind:
    -   Change the quantity of a product in my cart.
    -   Remove a product in my cart.
-   No one else should be able to edit my cart except me.
-   "Checkout" the items in my cart so I can purchase my desired goods.

-   Think of a typical user experience on popular websites from a guest user and logged-in user perspective. You can just start by simulating the experience of checking out with a simple confirmation page.

2. As a logged-in customer, I want to be able to:

-   Have a persistent cart so I can revisit and pick up where I left off.
-   Be logged in across multiple devices: If I'm logged in on my mobile device and add some items to my cart, when I open the browser on my laptop and log in, I want to see those items in my cart.
-   No one else should be able to edit my cart except me.

3. As an administrator, I want to be able to:

-   Have validated data to ensure reliability (i.e., each customer that creates an account should only be able to do so once with a single email address).
-   Have full rights to make backend requests to add, edit, and remove products. No one else should have access.
-   View user information. No one else should have access.

4. As an engineer, I want to:

-   Have a well-seeded database so that I am able to simulate a number of different scenarios for the user stories below.
-   User data to be secure so that no one can unrightfully manipulate information.

# FS-App-Template

## Setup

To use this as boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

-   Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty
    directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on
    Github and clone it to your local machine)

-   Now you will have to add the fs-app-template as a remote and merge it into your own repository.

```
git remote add boilermaker git@github.com:FullstackAcademy/fs-app-template-v2.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/main
git branch -m master main
```

## Customize

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

-   Update project name and description in `package.json`
-   `npm install`
-   Create two postgres databases (`MY_APP_NAME` should match the `name`
    parameter in `package.json`):
-   These commands will create both your **development** and **test** databases

```
createdb graceshopper
createdb graceshopper-test
```

-   By default, running `npm test` will use your test database, while
    regular development uses development database

## Start

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

-   start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
-   start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
-   start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
